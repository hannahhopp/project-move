# Build Log

Projects never progress in a straight line. Here, I aim to outline what I do, have a place to talk things out to myself, and act as a reference should I forget something I've done.

*How do you get started on your dreams?*
*Start.*

## 8 September 2018

* Start the groundwork for what I want out of this project
  * MVP
* Get React Native up and running
  * Requires using Expo? Meh. Why do you need to make an account for so many services? This is why I want the app to be offline.

Confused by getting started with Expo. Both `create-react-native-app` and `expo` are initialized in a similar way, by running an init command which makes a new folder. I can't run both sequentially, bc you can't use the init command for either if the folder already exists?

*Solution*: cra has expo integrated already. Woo.

Problem: My desktop is hooked up to ethernet, my phone to wifi. Expo needs me to be on the same Wifi connection..
Trying to get ramped up on laptop which is able to connect to wifi.

Dealing with dependency bs.

Can't get app to load on expo .. what is the create-react-native app starter scripting doing?

Wow, getting this started is stupid

*SOLUTION* The link sent through the `npm start` script doesn't work. But, using the link sent from the desktop XDE app *does*.

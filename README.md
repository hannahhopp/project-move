# PROJECT MOVE

A bodyweight fitness app that illustrates and tracks the recommended routine variations.

* The Recommended Routine ([x](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine))
* Move ([x](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/move))
* The Minimalist Routine ([x](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/minroutine))
* Skill Day Routine ([x](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/skillday))

## QUALITIES

### Things I like about the current BWF app

* Easy to change progressions
* GIFs to illustrate movements
* Built-in timers
* Fairly minimalist
* Easy to use
* There are different routines listed (Mobility, etc), but it took me over a year of using the app to realize it was there

### Things I don't like about the current BWF app

* Tracking is a bit lack luster
* It's kind of ugly
* The timer doesn't keep running if you go to a different app
* No alarm customization

### Things that the current app doesn't have but may improve it

* Progress photos or videos integrated with the app
* Reminders
* Inspiration
  * Links to Cali Move, ThenX, Bodyweight Warrior videos
* Comprehensive mirroring of the /r/bodyweightfitness [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/index)
* Achievements
  * What makes the achievements worthwhile? If this gained traction, it could be badges on the sub.
  * This could be abused.

### Ideas

* Small questionaire when user opens app for the first time to figure out which routine would be ideal to follow
* Make tracking better
  * research work out or habit tracking apps that do this well
* Reminders for the special days on reddit, e.g. Form Check Fridays or Sunday Show Off
  * Alternatively, spotlights from each
    * Consent?
  * Fitness transformation spotlight for those who post after a year

## IDEALS

* Offline
* Keep fluff to a minimum
* The focus is /r/bodyweightfitness

## TECH

* React Native

## MVP

* Go through the routines outlined above
  * Every movement has a
    * timer / rep count
    * animation
    * progression selection
    * reference to the section in the wiki
* You can select what routine you want before you workout

## QUALITIES

### Things I like about the current BWF app

* Easy to change progressions
* GIFs to illustrate movements
* Built-in timers
* Fairly minimalist
* Easy to use
* There are different routines listed (Mobility, etc), but it took me over a year of using the app to realize it was there

### Things I don't like about the current BWF app

* Tracking is a bit lack luster
* It's kind of ugly
* The timer doesn't keep running if you go to a different app
* No alarm customization

## IDEALS

* Offline
* Keep fluff to a minimum
* The focus is /r/bodyweightfitness

## TECH

* React Native
  * Expo.io for development
* Waffle.io for issue tracking
* GraphQL

### Personal goals

* Learn React Native and GraphQL
* Learn how to deploy a viable product for a real public audience
* Learn how to write testable code
* Learn how to write tests
* Make a cool app

## MVP

* Go through the beginner/intermediate routines outlined above
  * Every movement has a
    * timer / rep count
    * animation
    * progression selection
    * reference to the section in the wiki
* You can select what routine you want before you workout

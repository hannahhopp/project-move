# Ideas

* Small questionaire when user opens app for the first time to figure out which routine would be ideal to follow
* Make tracking better
  * research work out or habit tracking apps that do this well
* Reminders for the special days on reddit, e.g. Form Check Fridays or Sunday Show Off
  * Alternatively, spotlights from each
    * Consent?
  * Fitness transformation spotlight for those who post after a year
* Progress tracker within workout as you're doing it on the top of the exercise (like exercise 3/10),  or some indicator of getting near the end
* timer changes color as you get closer to being done
* in the reading section of each exercise, have diagrams of
  * muscle groups being activated
  * ways you could hurt yourself if you're not careful
* in exercises, it'd be nice to see what time / rep count you did in your last work out without having to dig for it
* Tapping a routine blows up the button to show you the core goals of each routine
  * Con: means the user has to tap twice to get started
* Make it easy to update if the routines change...
  * Is there an API to fetch FAQ data? eh, but then you'd have to be online...
* Progress photos or videos integrated with the app
* Reminders
* Inspiration
  * Links to Cali Move, ThenX, Bodyweight Warrior videos
* Comprehensive mirroring of the /r/bodyweightfitness [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq) and [Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/index)
* Achievements
